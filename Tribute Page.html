            <li>Marie Curie, n√©e Maria Sklodowska, was born in Warsaw on November 7, 1867, the daughter of a secondary-school teacher.</li>
            <li>
                In 1891, she went to Paris to continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she obtained Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences.
            </li>
            <li>
                Curie developed methods for the separation of radium from radioactive residues in sufficient quantities to allow for its characterization and the careful study of its properties, therapeutic properties in particular.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mme. Curie throughout her life actively promoted the use of radium to alleviate suffering and during World War I, assisted by her daughter, Irene, she personally devoted herself to this remedial work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mme. Curie, quiet, dignified and unassuming, was held in high esteem and admiration by scientists throughout the world.
            </li>
            <li>
                Together with her husband, she was awarded half of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, for their study into the spontaneous radiation discovered by Becquerel, who was awarded the other half of the Prize.
            </li>
            <li>In 1911 she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in recognition of her work in radioactivity.</li>
            <li>
                She also received, jointly with her husband, the Davy Medal of the Royal Society in 1903 and, in 1921, President Harding of the United States, on behalf of the women of America, presented her with one gram of radium in recognition of her service to science.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mme. Curie died in Savoy, France, after a short illness, on July 4, 1934.
